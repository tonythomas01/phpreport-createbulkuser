# phpreport-createbulkuser
This script helps to create users in bulk for https://github.com/igalia/phpreport

The script can read `usernames` from a text file `username.txt` as per hardcoded in the code. 

Please note that the existing code sets `username` and `password` same for the new user. This can be extended later to support custom password for user.
